For example your coffee maker is connected to your alarm clock and no matter what time up the alarm goes off, coffee is brewed. Your colleagues at work can be notified of your possible delay because of possible traffic jams on your way to office. Your home automation can shut the lights and adjust  temperature when everyone is away. According to Samsung in 2020, every device Samsung sells world wide will be connected to the Internet of Things. Since leading manufacturers of our digital devices have such goals, it is no wonder that Gartner predicts that there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the Internet of Things by 2020.

APIOps extends the \u201c\nPeople over Process over Tools\n,\u201d and urges API developer  +  system operator + 3\nrd\n party service developer collaboration.\n\n\nAPIOps Principles\n \u2013 APIOps at the conceptual level is based on Agile\u2019s and DevOps principles to focus on effective collaborative design, development and maintenance of APIs to enable extremely fast and flexible service design and development.\n\n\nAPIOps Methods\n \u2013 You can use Scrum with operations, Kanban with operations, etc. Provide methods to collaboratively design APIs for service development utilizing the principles of design first approach.\n\n\nAPIOps Practices\n \u2013 Provide low barrier access to reliable APIs, documentation supporting usage, sandboxes to test and build on top of, generated libraries and code examples for service developers. \n\n\nAPIOps Tools\n \u2013 Tools you\u2019d use in the commission of these principles. In the APIOps world there\u2019s a lot of  emerging tools and evolving standards in provisioning (docker, vagrant), design (RAML, API Blueprint, Swagger), API server code generation (\nDrakov\n ), generating OS specific libraries (\nAPIMATIC\n ), managing APIs (apinf.com, 3scale.com,) and many more.\n\n\n\n\nAPI design first development process\n\n\n\n\nJoint open design process\n\n\n[DRAWING OF PEOPLE DOING COOPERATION]\n\n\nAPI design first approach focuses on involving service and API developers and marketing to same process of co-creating API description. API description is a communication tool, it is not code, at best it is browser-based graphical userface in which all participants collaborate and contribute. Process involves 3rd party service developers into the development since they are endusers of APIs and know best the needs. Obviously the product owner of service utlizing APIs is involved. During the process all work together; sometimes intensively and occasionally there might be total silence. The  team uses f2f meetigns and online environments as well as instant messaging tools to communicate. In other words, there is no written rule or need to necessary to be all the time in the  space/room. This phase produces shared version controlled understanding of:\n\n\n\n\nAPI feautures\n\n\nAPI consumer needs\n\n\nMachine readable description of API or multiple APIs\n\n\n\n\nSpeed up development with code generation\n\n\nIn the  second phase APIOps (API developer) uses the machine readable  description file to configure code generation toolchain. Toolchain automatically generates both API server skeleton and client side development kits (SDK) for plethora of operating systems including mobile platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows. \n\n\nGenerating API server code kicks the development at fullspeed right from the start. API developer needs to adjust and finetune actual code a lot less compared to other approaches. The SDKs are important since they lower the barrier to utilize newly created APIs. Having top knotch API is nice, but widely utilized and liked API is golden. \n\n\nService Development Platform as online hub\n\n\nEventually API server code is launched at production server and attached to API management, which is part of Developer Portal (DP). DP enables service developers' easy access to APIs, API documentation, SDKs, code examples and community. In Developer Portal  API provider can limit the usage of APIs, see metrics and even retire entire API. In portal, API developers and consumers can exchange ideas and use documented comments as feedback for the next cycle which begins from the Joint open design process.  \n\n\nAll this should take plane inside planned roadmap and business plan. Internet of Things (IoT) is something  which in common terms connects devices to each other to exchange data.  IoT relies heavily on web APIs which in fact enable us to connect  services and objects with each other. Without reliable, easily  implemented backends and frontend support, new services build on top of  IoT, will not succeed. \n\n\nWhat can we do for you\n\n\nSolutions and services apinf \n Sampo Software can provide: \n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding and experties of API lifecycle and development\n\n\nFullstack API design process and browser based toolchain\n\n\nAgile APIs driven Service Development Platform\n\n\nAPIOps  as hired guns to speed up your IoT service development\n\n\nTop API management solution\n\n\nCommunity discussion platform: \nhttps://apiops.slack.com\n established - join now!",

Process involves 3rd party service developers into the development since they are endusers of APIs and know best the needs. Obviously the product owner of service utlizing APIs is involved. During the process all work together; sometimes intensively and occasionally there might be total silence. The  team uses f2f meetigns and online environments as well as instant messaging tools to communicate. In other words, there is no written rule or need to necessary to be all the time in the  space/room. This phase produces shared version controlled understanding of:   API feautures  API consumer needs  Machine readable description of API or multiple APIs   Speed up development with code generation  In the  second phase APIOps (API developer) uses the machine readable  description file to configure code generation toolchain. Toolchain automatically generates both API server skeleton and client side development kits (SDK) for plethora of operating systems including mobile platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows.   Generating API server code kicks the development at fullspeed right from the start. API developer needs to adjust and finetune actual code a lot less compared to other approaches. The SDKs are important since they lower the barrier to utilize newly created APIs. Having top knotch API is nice, but widely utilized and liked API is golden.   Service Development Platform as online hub  Eventually API server code is launched at production server and attached to API management, which is part of Developer Portal (DP). DP enables service developers' easy access to APIs, API documentation, SDKs, code examples and community. In Developer Portal  API provider can limit the usage of APIs, see metrics and even retire entire API. In portal, API developers and consumers can exchange ideas and use documented comments as feedback for the next cycle which begins from the Joint open design process.    All this should take plane inside planned roadmap and business plan. Internet of Things (IoT) is something  which in common terms connects devices to each other to exchange data.  IoT relies heavily on web APIs which in fact enable us to connect  services and objects with each other. Without reliable, easily  implemented backends and frontend support, new services build on top of  IoT, will not succeed.",

You will learn why your organizations should  apply APIOps practices and values to gain maximum from APIs driven  business whether it's IoT or something else. This new concept will lower the learning curve to utilize APIs, minimizes man-made errors, helps to mimize development risks and costs, and maximizes your API customer satisfaction. Presentation is a story of how this concept was build so far and what is to come. \n\n\nFast API development together with customers\n\n\nWeb APIs, or more specifically REST APIs, are key for connecting devices to the Internet. Companies focusing on enabling fast API development together with customers and nearby interest groups will rule the IoT. \n\n\nAPIOps can be seen to extend DevOps\n\n\nJust like DevOps can be seen as offspring or spinoff of Agile thinking, APIOps can be seen to extend DevOps to fulfil the needs of Application Interface and Internet of Things development (IoT). \n\n\nTogether APIOps and APItalist are winning combination\n\n\nTogether APIOps and APItalist are winning combination. APIOps alone does not do the trick. They are highly talented and trained API tech experts. They need the help of APItalist - the talent to create business plans and API-strategies.

Working agreements are a set of rules or processes the team identifies and formulates together and agrees to follow to become more efficient as a team.\n\n\nFirstly, we had individual brainstorming to gather insights on issues (both positive ad negative) related to past/current team cooperation. The insights were gathered on sticky notes. Each team member presented their post-it notes, which were then grouped to 6 groups.

Working agreements are a set of rules or processes the team identifies and formulates together and agrees to follow to become more efficient as a team.  Firstly, we had individual brainstorming to gather insights on issues (both positive ad negative) related to past/current team cooperation. The insights were gathered on sticky notes. Each team member presented their post-it notes, which were then grouped to 6 groups. We started working on the most popular groups, used dot voting to identify the most important issues. Based on the findings, we formulated 5 working agreements.  Our set of working agreements  Emphasize teamwork by daily pair programming and task splitting.  Participate in sprint pre-planning at least once a month.  Keep meetings brief and relevant.  Communicate task progress on daily basis by updating time estimates and linking PR's and commits.  Always review others' work thoroughly.  List of sticky notes collected in the exercise  Collaboration   Pair programming  Working in pairs sharing tasks  Pre-planning needs more team involvement  standups  Laughs and jokes during the day   we have a good spritit  Handling conflicts   Long standups Peer review    reviews   commits  updating task status on Waffle  Keeping tasks updated regularly   Commenting issues/progress in  tasks (Waffle) Working space    Tight working space.
